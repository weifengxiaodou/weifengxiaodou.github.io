     * 7. Map Projections
     * 
     * Just like we set up a linear scale for mapping data values to pixel positions
     * in a bar chart or scatter plot (e.g., with linearScale), we need to create a
     * function that maps raw coordinate values given in the geoJSON file into screen
     * pixels. There is no one way of using projections for creating maps. In general,
     * the visible size of a countries boundary shape depends on the projection used
     * to make it visible. See this: https://www.thetruesize.com
     * 
     * In the following we will set up a "flat" map projection otherwise known as
     * spherical Mercator projection (an equirectangular projection).
     * 
     * For more information on projections that d3 implements, see:
     * https://github.com/d3/d3-geo#azimuthal-projections
